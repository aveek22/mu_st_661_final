### Project 2 - Portuguese Banking Product

A dataset from a Portuguese banking institution marketing campaign recorded many variables and a
binary response (y) indicating whether or not the client subscribed to a term deposit. The dataset can be downloaded and further information on it is available here.

Build an appropriate logistic regression model and provide a detailed interpretation of the final model. Compare and contrast the model fitting process and capabilities for fitting logistic regression models using SAS, R, Python and Minitab software.
